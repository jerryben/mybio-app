## About Me

Iâ€™m **Jeremiah Onwoh**, an IT professional with over 10 years of experience in network administration, cloud-based infrastructures, and automation. I specialize in deploying, optimizing, and managing both off-cloud networks (LAN/WAN) and cloud infrastructures on AWS, Azure, and GCP. This demo project represents a part of my learning journey in DevOps, including various tools and techniques I've mastered.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For creating the front-end tech bio page.
- **Terraform**: For automating infrastructure provisioning.
- **Docker**: For containerizing applications.
- **Kubernetes**: For managing containerized workloads.
- **Ansible**: For configuration management and deployment automation.
- **Bash Scripting**: For automating processes and server management.
- **AWS, Azure, GCP**: Cloud platforms used to deploy the infrastructure.
- **Git**: Version control for managing code.

## Features

- **Tech Bio Webpage**: A single-page HTML page that details my professional journey and skills.
- **Automated Infrastructure**: Includes a Terraform setup for provisioning cloud resources.
- **Containerization**: Demonstrates Dockerfile creation and container orchestration using Kubernetes.
- **Configuration Management**: Shows Ansible playbooks for automating server configurations.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Terraform
- Ansible
- Kubernetes CLI
- A cloud account (AWS, Azure, GCP)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jerryben/bio-portfolio.git
   cd bio-portfolio
   ```

2. **Set up Docker**:

   - Build the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t portfolio-site .
     ```
   - Run the container:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 80:80 portfolio-site
     ```

3. **Deploy with Terraform**:

   - Navigate to the Terraform directory:
     ```bash
     cd terraform
     ```
   - Initialize and apply the infrastructure:
     ```bash
     terraform init
     terraform apply
     ```

4. **Configure with Ansible**:
   - Navigate to the Ansible playbook directory:
     ```bash
     cd ansible
     ```
   - Run the playbook to configure servers:
     ```bash
     ansible-playbook setup.yml
     ```

### Kubernetes (Optional)

If you're deploying with Kubernetes:

1. **Deploy the Kubernetes cluster**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yml
   ```

## Usage

- Visit the deployed webpage at `http://localhost` if running locally, or at the cloud-provided URL after deployment.
- Explore the source code in the `terraform`, `ansible`, and `docker` directories to understand infrastructure automation and containerization setups.
